        <section id="critical">
            <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
            <p>Critical thinking involves evaluating information objectively and making reasoned judgments.  It's about questioning assumptions, considering different perspectives, and forming your own conclusions based on evidence and logic.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="fallacies">
            <h2>Logical Fallacies</h2>
            <p>Logical fallacies are flaws in reasoning that can make an argument invalid.  Recognizing common fallacies can help you identify weak arguments and construct stronger ones yourself.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Applications of Logic</h2>
            <p>Logic has numerous applications in various fields, from computer science and mathematics to law and philosophy.  It's a fundamental tool for problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding the world around us.</p>
